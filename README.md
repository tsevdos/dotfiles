My bash related configs, settings and aliases ;-)

My CLI tools

- [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/): a fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal emulator with many out of the box features and customizations.
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit): a cool git shell tool
- [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli): for conventional commits
- [starship](https://starship.rs/): for shell prompt customization (if you can't install [ghostty terminal](https://ghostty.org/))
